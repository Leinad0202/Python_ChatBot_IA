Python_ChatBot_IA
Python_ChatBot_IA is a simple, functional chatbot built with Python and Streamlit. It connects to the OpenAI API to handle natural language conversations in real-time. The application is lightweight and has no dependencies beyond the streamlit and openai Python libraries. Importantly, it follows best practices for secret management: the OpenAI API key is never hard-coded, but loaded from an environment variable (named OPENAI_API_KEY)
help.openai.com
github.com
. This ensures the key remains private (as recommended by OpenAI) and isn’t exposed in source control.
Features
Interactive Chat Interface: Uses a Streamlit web app to let users send messages and receive responses from an OpenAI model. The UI is simple and easy to use.
OpenAI-powered Responses: Connects to the OpenAI API (e.g. GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) to generate replies to user input. Similar projects allow selecting different GPT models and adjusting parameters like temperature and max tokens

.
Secure Key Handling: Loads the OPENAI_API_KEY from an environment variable (not from code) to protect your secret key

.
Minimal Dependencies: Only requires installing streamlit and openai. This makes setup and deployment straightforward (see Installation below).
Lightweight and Extensible: The code is open-source and easy to modify. You can extend it to support more features (for example, streaming outputs or additional model settings as suggested in similar examples
github.com
).
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ – The OpenAI Python client requires Python 3.8 or higher
github.com
.
pip – To install Python packages (streamlit, openai, etc.).
OpenAI API Key – You must have an OpenAI account and obtain an API key from the OpenAI dashboard. This key is used by the app to authenticate requests.
(Optional) python-dotenv – Although not strictly required, it is recommended (by OpenAI’s official guidance) to use the python-dotenv package. This allows you to put your API key in a .env file, and automatically load it into the environment
github.com
. Installing it is simple: pip install python-dotenv.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copiar
Editar
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python_ChatBot_IA.git
cd Python_ChatBot_IA
Install required packages. For example, using pip:
bash
Copiar
Editar
pip install streamlit openai
This installs Streamlit and the OpenAI Python client. (As shown in the OpenAI library’s documentation, you can install it via pip install openai
github.com
.)
(Optional) If you plan to use a .env file for configuration, install python-dotenv:
bash
Copiar
Editar
pip install python-dotenv
Configuration
To securely provide your OpenAI API key to the app, follow these steps:
Create a .env file in the project root (same directory as main.py).
Add your API key to the .env file in the following format (note the sk- prefix):
ini
Copiar
Editar
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
For example, one maintainer suggests including a template .env file with just OPENAI_API_KEY=sk- and adding the real key after cloning
github.com
. This key always starts with sk-, so your file might look like OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-1234abcd...
github.com
.
Secure the .env file by adding it to .gitignore. This ensures your secret key does not get committed to version control
github.com
help.openai.com
.
Load the key in code. In your Python code (e.g. in main.py), fetch the key from the environment. For example:
python
Copiar
Editar
import os
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai.api_key = api_key
This uses os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") to read the key into the OpenAI client
github.com
. (If using python-dotenv, make sure to call load_dotenv() early in your script so that the .env values are loaded into os.environ
github.com
.)
By following this setup, you keep your API key out of the source code, adhering to OpenAI’s security recommendations
help.openai.com
github.com
.
Usage
After installation and configuration, run the chatbot app with Streamlit:
bash
Copiar
Editar
streamlit run main.py
This will start the Streamlit development server. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 (or the URL shown in the console). You should see the chat interface. Simply type your messages into the input box and the app will display responses generated by the OpenAI model.
